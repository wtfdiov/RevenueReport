# RevenueReport

Simple React Native app to display report data.

Firstly you may have an updated environment for running React-Native apps:
[RN Environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Then it's just execute those commands and the app may pop in your chosen emulator:

<ul>
  <li>1. npm install</li>
  <li>2-a. npm run android</li>
  <li>2-b. npm run ios</li>
</ul>
